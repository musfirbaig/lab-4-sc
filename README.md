# Lab 04: Test-First Programming

## Introduction
Lab 04 provides hands-on experience in test-first programming. Students will engage with a set of specifications to write unit tests that verify compliance and subsequently implement code that meets those specifications.

### Material
- [MIT OpenCourseWare: Problem Set 1](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/psets/ps1/)
- Lectures on LMS regarding Designing Specifications and Testing

### Test-First Programming Steps:
1. Study the specifications of the methods carefully.
2. Write JUnit tests for the methods according to the specifications.
3. Implement the methods according to the specifications.
4. Revise your implementation and enhance your test cases until your implementation passes all tests.

## Task 1: Extracting Data from Tweets
In this task, you will test and implement the methods in `Extract.java`. The `Extract.java` file can be found in the `src` folder, and the corresponding JUnit test class `ExtractTest.java` is located in the `test` folder. This separation of implementation code from test code is a common practice that helps maintain clarity and organization.


## Task 2: Filtering Lists of Tweets
In this task, you will test and implement the methods in `Filter.java`.


## Conclusion
This lab emphasizes the importance of test-first programming in software development, ensuring that your code meets the specifications while providing a structured approach to implementation and testing.
